 # 📊 QuickBite Express – Crisis Recovery Analysis (Power BI)

 ## 🏢 Project Overview

QuickBite Express is a Bengaluru-based online food delivery startup founded in 2020.
In June 2025, the company faced a major crisis due to:
 - Viral food safety violations at partner restaurants
- A week-long delivery outage during monsoon season
- Aggressive competitor campaigns during the disruption

This project analyzes how the crisis impacted customers, orders, revenue, and delivery reliability, and provides data-driven recovery insights for leadership decision-making.
